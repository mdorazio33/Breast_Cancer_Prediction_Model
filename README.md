# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Model

For this project, I decided to create a prediction model using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree for a Breast Cancer dataset which was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. This dataset contains information on how core tumors relate to malignant or benign breast cancer diagnosis, making it an excellent choice for Machine Learning and classification applications. The variables contained in the original dataset consist of a mean_radius column, a mean_texture column, a mean_perimeter column, a mean_area column, a mean_smoothness column, and a diagnosis column reflecting the results of 569 total patients. My reasoning for choosing this dataset comes from a combination of factors.

Due to breast cancer being the second leading cause of cancer death in women, I wanted to create a model that could predict diagnoses in order to help both patients and healthcare professionals alike assess the probability of a tumor being categorized as Malignant or Benign based on accumulating factors. Hopefully, models like this may help healthcare professionals better diagnose cancerous and non-cancerous tumors early on in their development.

The libraries I used throughout this project mainly consist of Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and MLxtend. Be sure to have them installed ahead of time if you seek to recreate this project in any form.
